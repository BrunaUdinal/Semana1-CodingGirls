Ending up, just another lost and lonely wife
You count up the years, and they will be filled with tears, oooh
Love only breaks up, to start over again
You'll get the babies, but you won't have your man
While he is busy loving every woman that he can, huh huh
Say I wanna leave a thousand times a day
It's easier said that done, when I just can't break away
Just can't break away
Young hearts, run free
Never be hung up, hung up like my man and me (oooh)
Hmmm, my man and me
Young hearts, to yourself be true
Don't be no fool when loving is all there is (oooh)
I said I don't love you
It's high time, just one crack at life
Who we want to live in, trouble and strife
My mind must be free, to learn all I can about me
I'm gonna love me for the rest of my days
Caress the babies every time they say
Self resevation is what's really going on today, oooh
Say I wanna leave a thousand times a day
How can I turn loose
When you just can't break away (just can't break away)
Young hearts, run free
Never be hung up, hung up like my man and me (oooh)
Oooh, my man and me
Whoa, young hearts, to yourself be true
Don't be no fool when loving is all there is (oooh)
I said I don't love you, hmmm
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Young hearts, run free
Never be hung up, hung up like my man and me (oooh)
Whoa, my man and me
Whoa, young hearts, to yourself be true
Don't be no fool when loving is all there is (oooh)
No, yeah aaah aaah aaah
Young hearts, run free...";
